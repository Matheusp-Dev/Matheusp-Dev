  - 💬 I am 19 years old, currently living in Brazil. I have an advanced English and in the moment I'm a teacher of the language. I am studing Python, Javascript, React, HTML and CSS. I'm also a beguiner designer, which helped me develop important skills such as creativity, communication, marketing, analytical capability, community and social media management.
  - ⚡ I enjoy reading, whether it's a good book, as well as watching movies and playing games! I believe that our personal interests contribute to a more refined perception of things and problem-solving. \o/
